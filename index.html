            Why Do I like it so much? Here is why:

        <p>
            The reason I like it is because its a really legendary sports car. It also has a legendary engine, the 2JZ-GTE. The main course is its unlimited tuning potential. A whole performance parts store is a Supra MK4s oyster. Now you have a legendary car that can beat those stupid supercars around there. But if you make a lot of bizzarre modifications to the body and not the engine, then watch out because all the car fanboys are going too call you a ricer because of those ridiculous and unecessary modifications too your car. These days now ricers are becoming the new cool but now people are finally getting to their senses. Keep classy cars classy. Thats what im trying to say. Anyways to the engine. Like I said the Engine is a 2JZ-GTE but there is more to that. A 2JZ has a piston alignment that is straight and vertical(and has six pistons), also called an inline six. If you don't know how an engine works and what pistons are, then I will explain. So first there is a small chamber where the piston goes and all the combustion happens. There is also a picture down below if you want to see it. Its about the small chamber and the parts(By the way the small chamber is actually called the combustion chamber).</p><img src="supra%20jdm.png" id="SupraJDM">
        <p>First, the intake valve opens. The exhaust valve stays put because you don't want non mixed air already going out before there is nothing left to combust. So, like I was saying, the exhaust valve stays put. Then all the gases plus the air get mixed up together. That makes the piston move up, which also moves the crankshaft. That crankshafts rotation goes on the axle that moves the car. So, anyways, To make it go down, there is a little "spark plug" that ignites. When it ignites, it forcefully pushes out little sparks of electricity and fire which makes the piston move down and continues rotating the crankshaft. After that, the exhaust valve is opened. Forgot about that, didn't you? Oh well. Anyways, all the mixed gases and electricity/fire goes out of the Combustion chamber. This action keeps the car moving.
